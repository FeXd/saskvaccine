## ‚ÅâÔ∏è How & Why
**Sask Vaccine Bot** is a [Twitter bot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_bot) dedicated to **tracking COVID-19 vaccine age eligibility in Saskatchewan**.  
It is written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and uses the following packages:
- [urllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html) to pull information from the [Appointments for COVID-19 Vaccine Website](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/health-care-administration-and-provider-resources/treatment-procedures-and-guidelines/emerging-public-health-issues/2019-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-booking)
- [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) to read tweets from [@SKGov](https://twitter.com/SKGov) / [@SaskHealth](https://twitter.com/SaskHealth) and to tweet / retweet to [@saskvaccine](https://twitter.com/saskvaccine)
- [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) to set environment variables from a `.env` file

_The Saskatchewan Health Authority_ does a fairly good job updating everyone via their [website](https://www.saskhealthauthority.ca/) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/SaskHealth). But many people in Saskatchewan (myself included) are just looking for one thing... **when can we sign up to get vaccinated!?**  

People can subscribe to notifications from [@saskvaccine](https://twitter.com/saskvaccine) for up to date COVID-19 vaccine age eligibility, rather than feeling the need to refresh the [Appointments for COVID-19 Vaccine Website](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/health-care-administration-and-provider-resources/treatment-procedures-and-guidelines/emerging-public-health-issues/2019-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-booking) or their twitter feed over and over again.
