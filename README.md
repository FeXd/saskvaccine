# Sask Vaccine
🤖 Bot to track COVID-19 vaccine age requirement in #SK.  
⏰ Tweets when info changes & every morning around 8 am.  
💻 Maintained by [@FeXd](https://github.com/FeXd).

## ⁉️ How and Why
**Sask Vaccine** is a simple Python3 script that uses [urllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html) to pull information from the [Appointments for COVID-19 Vaccine Website](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/health-care-administration-and-provider-resources/treatment-procedures-and-guidelines/emerging-public-health-issues/2019-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-booking) and [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) to tweet updates to [@saskvaccine](https://twitter.com/saskvaccine).

_The Saskatchewan Health Authority_ does a fairly good job updating everyone via their [website](https://www.saskhealthauthority.ca/) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/SaskHealth). But many people in Saskatchewan (myself included) are just looking for one thing... **when can we sign up to get vaccinated!?**  

This bot is dedicated to just that, so that people can check [@saskvaccine](https://twitter.com/saskvaccine) quickly and easily, rather than feeling the need to refresh the [Appointments for COVID-19 Vaccine Website](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/health-care-administration-and-provider-resources/treatment-procedures-and-guidelines/emerging-public-health-issues/2019-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-booking) over and over again.
